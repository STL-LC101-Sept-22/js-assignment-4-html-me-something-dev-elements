         <p>&emsp;Music is amazing and so wonderful and experienced in different or the same ways to people. Some people like certain genres and some, like myself, love music from all types of genres and even some forgein music. I can usually find music to fit a mood or feeling or... that puts me in a mood or feeling. I wanted to share 10 random songs that I liked, but I couldn't decide which songs to actually add out of the hundreds I love. So, to make it easier for myself, I decided to go with 10 Cover Songs that I like instead.</p>
